                            <h3>Dogs:</h3><hr>
                                <p>Many people say that a dog is the most rewarding pet there is. And it is true...a dog will love you like no other pet can. Dogs are Man's (and Women's)  Best Friend. At the same time, adding a dog to your household is a huge expense. The initial purchase of a dog can range from $300 to $3,000. And the costs don't stop there. Plan on spending a few thousand dollars a year for veterinary bills, food, grooming, and boarding. If this isn't in your budget, then a dog isn't right for you. Dogs also require a large time commitment. Someone should be home with the dog 4-6 hours each day (not including sleeping), and dogs can't be left alone longer than 6 hours. You need to be prepared to walk your dog three times a day.</p>

						    <h3>Cats:</h3><hr> 
						        <p>In many ways, cats are an easier pet than a dog. They understand the litter box instinctively and and a healthy cat will rarely have accidents. Many cats, but not all, are very loving. Kittens are very cute but will certainly test your patience. An adult cat can be an excellent companion. There is a reason why cat videos are so popular...cats are always doing something entertaining. With a cat, you need to be prepared to clean the litter box EVERY DAY. That is only fair to your cat. Also, many people are allergic to cats, and you may be allergic as well. Before you get a cat, make sure everyone in your household has been around cats and do not show signs of allergies.  We cannot stress how important this is, as many cats are brought to shelters because of family allergies.</p>

						<h3>Rodents, like Guinea Pigs or Gerbils:</h3><hr><p>If you can't make the commitment to a cat or dog, you could consider a rodent for a pet. Guinea pigs and gerbils can be fun to watch and you may even be able to tame them and hold them.  Both Guinea pigs and gerbils are highly social animals and they need to have a companion. You need to feed them everyday, and clean their cage every few days. Rats also make very fun pets, and they are smarter and more affectionate than most rodents.</p>

						<h3>Lizards and Fish:</h3><hr> <p>We also sell lizards and fish. Setting up a tank can be a rather expensive proposition. Lizards and fish generally won't be affectionate, but they may come towards you when they know you have food. We can help you find the right set up for your budget and willingness to care for a pet.</p>
